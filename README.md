As part of my CEH training, I developed a detailed Penetration Testing Agreement for a simulated client engagement. The scope included cloud-hosted ecommerce services, in-house IT infrastructure, and ransomware simulation testing—all aligned with industry best practices and ethical hacking methodologies. This exercise reinforced the importance of clear rules of engagement and compliance in real-world penetration testing.
